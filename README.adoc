== Introduction

*migrate* is a tool to execute Elastic Search scripts to migrate data.
The tool can:

* execute all the migrations
* undo all the migrations
* undo single migration
* read migration files
* load config from migrate-config.js file (by default)
* list the migrations (pending or executed)

The tool saves the state in a index, and runs *only* the migrations that are pending.

== How to use it?

To run CLI:



Use one or the other for executing migrations.

== Initialize the tool in new package/repo:

Executing `es-migrate init` will launch a quiz to config the tool.

== List migrations:

With `es-migrate list` will list all the migrations executed and pending.

== Run migrations:

With `es-migrate up` will execute each one of the migrations.

To undo all migrations by order, you can use `es-migrate down`.

To undo one migration you can use `es-migrate undo`, a list will appear before the undoing ðŸ˜€

To use another configuration file, you must specify the -c or --config parameter. Example:
`es-migrate up --config es-migrate-config.prod.js`.
